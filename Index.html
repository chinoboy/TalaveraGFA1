    we are a non-profit oragnization that aims to reduce pollutants in the ocean to save marine life
    our goal is to clean one community at a time and our manpower is slowly increasing due to recent news of oil spills
    improper garbage dumping and human intervention such as overfishing and hunting of endagered animals.
    Joining us can guarantee you news weeks before cleaning operations, volunteers at local communities near you will alert
    when a cleaning operation will happen and if the best happens we can expand internationally and uniting humans of different cultures
    for one singular goal and is to reduce pollution. Joining us can guarantee you a membership at any close organizations to us and by paying
    a little bit extra you can help us expand our organization to not cleaning seas but to feed children from less developed nations.
